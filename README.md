## Project Description
This project is a mini Twitter-style web app built with Python and Streamlit that can be hosted publicly online. Users can create an account and log in, post messages to a shared feed, like posts, and follow or unfollow other users. The app focuses on real-time interaction and simple social features, demonstrating how a lightweight social media platform can be created with Streamlit and deployed for public access.
